<h1>What is an "EOL sequence"?</h1>
<h1>
  <ul>
    <li>"EOL" stands for "end of line"</li>

  </ul>

<h3>Tell Me More</h3>
<p>Words normally appear next to each other on the same line. For example:</p>
<p>Apple Banana Carrot</p>
<p>We can split this line into three lines by putting an EOL sequence between each word:</p>
<p>Apple<br>Banana<br>Carrot</p>
<p>The EOL's are hidden. If you could see the EOL'S, it would look like this:</p>
<p>Apple(EOL)<br>Banana(EOL)<br>Carrot</p>
